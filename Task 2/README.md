# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
## Introduction
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that allows for the prediction of numerical outcomes, and this project offers hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting such a model.


## Project Description
In this project, we will:
- Obtain and prepare a dataset with numerical features and a target variable (house prices) for prediction.
- Explore and clean the data to ensure its quality and suitability for modeling.
- Select relevant features to include in the predictive model.
- Implement and train a linear regression model using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-Learn).
- Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
- Visualize the relationship between predicted and actual values to interpret the model’s results.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding linear regression concepts and applications.
- Practical experience in implementing a predictive model using linear regression.
- Skills in model evaluation and interpretation.
